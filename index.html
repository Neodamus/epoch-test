<h2>What is Epoch of Elements?</h2>

<p><em>EoE</em> is a modern turn-based strategy game which is played online in a one versus one setting. Inspiration for this game came from Chess, Heroes of Might&amp;Magic, and Dota2.</p>

<h2>What makes it fun?</h2>

<p>The number and diversity of hero-like units, abilities, buffs, and auras allows each player to build a customized army that suits their favorite playstyle. It's a battle of both strategic and tactical decision making, mind games, innovation, combos, counter-picking.</p>

<p>It's designed with both casual and hardcore players in mind. The goal is to make it easy for newbies to jump into the fray and have an enjoyable game, but it should take a more dedicated effort to master the intricacies of the battlefield.</p>

<h2>What are the future plans for EoE?</h2>

<p>We are always thinking about where Epoch of Elements is headed in the future as we want to make it one of the leading HTML5 games available on the Internet and possibly one day it's very own standalone game. There are already a few things we know we would like to add in the future such as generals and additional units for more variability and creativity in matches, different maps (and eventually random ones) to create a dynamic field on which to engage in battle, a world map mode to offer an even more immersive and sustained campaign, and the ability to play a game with more than just 2 players.

<p>On top of that, one of our main driving forces is to create a highly competitive community where winning gives a true sense of achievement and losing may lead to broken mice and keyboards. Once the game is at a level we feel is appropriate for competitive play, we will be hosting tournaments as well as full seasons which will have victors enjoying the spoils of war -- anything from upgraded game features to cash prizes.</p>

<p>Be sure to bookmark <a href="index.html">Epoch of Elements</a> and visit regularly as each day there could be something completely new to discover. Also, if you'd like to help make EoE an even better game, there are plenty of ways to <a href="support.html">support the game</a> or you can <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> with any suggestions you might have.</p>
