<p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 14px; width: 500px; font-style: italic;">No game can survive without an active and supportive community behind it. If you think EoE is a game worthy of your support, here are some ways that you can help grow the community and make it an even better game.</p>

<div class="page-container" style="max-width: 800px;">

	<div class="left" style="width: 25%; height: 125px;"><img src="images/support-like.png"></div>
    <div class="left" style="width: 75%; height: 125px;"><h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Share with Your Friends</h2></div>
    
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><p>By far, the easiest way to help build up the EoE community is to tell as many people as you know about it. Not only does it give you a chance to play the game with your friends, but eventually this will make it so that there's always a game up and you don't even have to know the person that you're playing against.</p> 
    <p>Ideally, you should be able to come to the site, hit quick game, and start a game within seconds if you like. This is the ultimate goal of the site.</p>
    <p>We've made it really easy for you to share this game with your friends by clicking any of the social buttons at the bottom of every page on this site, so you don't have to spend more than a few seconds to tell everyone you know and challenge them to a battle of the minds!</p></div>

    <div class="left" style="width: 75%; height: 125px; margin-top: 30px;"><h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Contribute Ideas</h2></div>
    
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><p>We're always brainstorming up ways to make Epoch a totally badass game and one of the most cerebral and enjoyable strategy games out there. But that doesn't mean that we think of every possible awesome idea and it doesn't even mean that all of our ideas are any good. </p>
    <p>If you have an intriguing idea that you think will make EoE even more epic, please share it with us. You can post it on our blog, tell us on any of the social platforms we use, or use the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
    <p>If we like your idea, then there's a good chance you'll see it an upcoming update. If your idea would be a dramatic change to the game but we think it's absolutely brilliant, then we will share it with the community and open it up to debate and discussion. If it sounds like a winner, we will add it to our list of necessary updates and incorporate it as soon as humanly possible.</p></div>

    <div class="left" style="width: 75%; height: 125px; margin-top: 30px;"><h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Help Promote</h2></div>
    
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><p>We know Epoch players will be just as avid about gaming as we are, and because of that, some of you will already be running your own gaming sites, blogs, and channels. If you fit into this category, we would love to have you talking about our game and telling those who follow you what you think about EoE.</p>
    <p>Also, if you decide to take the time to promote our game, we would like to help you in some way as well, so please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and let us know how we can scratch your back as well.</p></div>

    <div class="left" style="width: 75%; height: 125px; margin-top: 30px;"><h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Donate Time or Money</h2></div>
    
    <div style="text-align: justify;"><p>As of right now, we are a team of only 2 who do as much as we can day in and day out to constantly improve EoE. Currently, we don't make a dime but we put in as much time as a full time job or more.</p>
    <p>Obviously, no game can really reach its pinnacle of greatness without resources: that is, a team and money. The vision we have for this game far exceeds what we are capable of at this time such as 3d modeling, extremely dynamic user interaction, and cash prize tournaments.</p>
    <p>However, we are extremely driven and committed to the goal of making our vision for Epoch a reality, so that you, us, and the entire community can benefit by enjoying countless hours of competitive chaos.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to contribute your <b><u>TIME</u></b>, especially if you are an amazing artist, please be sure to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> with how you'd like to help out. If we can do anything to help you in return, please let us know. Also note that if Epoch takes off and we start hiring full time artists, those who contributed on their own free time will be at the top of the list.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to contribute <b><u>MONEY</u></b>, we have a Paypal account where we accept donations of any amount. All of the money we receive at this time will go into either one of 2 activities: hiring artists for projects or as part of a tournament prize pool. In other words, all of the money donated will go right back into the game.</p>
    <p>If you choose to donate money, let us know if there's some way we can help you out in return. You can donate by clicking the button below.</p></div>
